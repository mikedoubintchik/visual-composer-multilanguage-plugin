This is an add-on plugin for WPBakery Visual Composer that adds multilanguage support and functionality. Version 2.0 now also has automatic translations that you can turn on.

## Description

This is an add-on plugin for WPBakery Visual Composer that adds functionality of a language switcher, making it very easy to create a multi-language site without an additional multi-language or translation plugin.

In version 2.0, we've added support for automatic translations using the Google Cloud Translate API.
